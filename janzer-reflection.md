*What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

I was unsure about the merging of different branches with the main branch (when each branch has varied changes). I didn't have that many questions going into the GPS, and I have more questions coming out. This is a good thing, I like being aware of my ignorance.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*

It seems like merging different branches only will produce conflict if the branches are editing the same parts of the files. This cleared up some of the intelligent merging that GitHub talked about. This GPS also demonstrated the work flow when multiple people are working on the same repository. I also got more practice navigating the GitHub pages.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

We asked our guide about pull requests. I asked Jeff about the 'tail' command that he used. I asked quite a few questions, but I'm having trouble remembering them. Should have done this immediately afterwards!


*What still confuses you about git?*

I still have difficulty understanding conflicts and how they merge, because we were not able to do it locally. We resolved the conflict by pushing the branch to the repository, and then fetch/merging the master from the origin. I don't think this is the way we were supposed to go about it, but it worked.


*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
It was very enjoyable! It was nice being able to work with someone else who had a different set of strengths and curiosities. I enjoyed the unique experience from this paired programming experience, and I really look forward to pairing with others. I grow a lot in unexpected ways.

We also found some confusion in this challenge. Sometimes we were confused because there were important sentences in the middle of paragraphs and we did not read thoroughly enough. The more confusing part for me is that the directions were very clear updating our local repositories initially. However, after Release 4, I was not sure whether or not I should have updated my local directory by pulling from the GitHub repository that we just updated. Also we had trouble attaining the right results from release 5 (as I mentioned earlier), but that might just be us.

Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. I like working with other people, and I'm excited for the opportunity do this more.
